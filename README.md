# Koskila's Home Assistant configuration

Heya, and welcome to take a look at my Home Assistant configuration. This repository contains a slightly outdated (I'm only committing changes when I feel like doing it) version of my live Home Assistant configuration. Well, and some of the component files etc, because damn If I'm going to figure out what actually belongs here and what doesn't.


## What's in it

Essentially, 2 separate things.
- DockerCompose -folder contains any configuration and ntoes I've had to make for actually running the Home Assistant container.
- HomeAssistant -folder contains all customizations and confgurations to Home Assistant itself.

## What's it for

This setup is suitable(?) or at least used for a medium-sized (~180m^2 / 1940 sqf) Finnish single-family-house. I'm slowly bringing new stuff online, but I currently have:
- Solar panels (and other electricity -related tweaks)
- Different dashboards
- A couple of cameras (recording etc. is done with another tool)
- Weather stuff
- Robot lawn mowers
- Some sensors around the house

Other stuff is being built as I find the time.
